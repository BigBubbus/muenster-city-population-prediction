# muenster-city-population-prediction
In this project I try some R coding using simple linear regression. 

Disclaimer: The prediction is a very simple task, we only have population number data, which is great, since there is a high correlation between years and population. However, being realistic, we will need way more than that to actually predict something nice here.

# How to Start
Import the files into R Studio and let the .rmd file do its magic. The goal is to have a visual representation of the population in the coming years, as well, as an model that can be used for prediction.
